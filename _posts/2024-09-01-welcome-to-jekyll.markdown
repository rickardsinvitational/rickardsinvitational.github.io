 This year the Invitational will be held in-person on Saturday, November 9th, 2024. To expand our competition, we are incorporating a nationwide mail-in division this year. Schools may register to compete online from anywhere in the country. After the tests have been taken, the schools will send in PDF files of their scantrons and results will be displayed at an online ceremony at a later time. Awards for mail-in will be in a separate division than in-person. Please read the Competition Handbook pertaining to your level, included below, for further details on the updated format, and send any inquiries you have to our email at rickardsinvitational@gmail.com.
